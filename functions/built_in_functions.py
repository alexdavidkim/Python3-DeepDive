# Illustrating that variables are simply pointers or references to objects in memory. Those objects store the type of the object (str, int, etc). This is called a dynamic typing language. Other languages like Java and C++ require the variable to be assigned to a data type and can not alter from that type. Also, when you change the value associated with a variable, you are not changing the current object in memory, you are creating a new object in a new location in memory.
# my_var = 'hello'
# print(type(my_var))
# print(id(my_var))
# my_var = 10
# print(type(my_var))
# print(id(my_var))
